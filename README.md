# Arduino-LED-blink
This is the Arduino project to blink an LED.

Go through the 'Main Code' for the code.
copy and paste it in the 'Arduino IDE' and upload it to your Arduino.

The arduino contains one on-board LED which is connected to digital pin 13.
This project will work with the both.
For external LED connect LED's long pin to Digital pin 13 and short leg to gnd pin.
Their is no need of resistor in this because pin 13 already contains resistor.
If you want to connect it with other pin use a 220ohm or 330ohm resistor. But you need to change program for that.
